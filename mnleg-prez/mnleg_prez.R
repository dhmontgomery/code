# A function to look up the share of the 2016 two-party presidential vote Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump received in a specified Minnesota legislative district.
# Takes two inputs: district (either a number or a string, depending on the chamber) and house (a boolean that defaults to T)
# If house = T, then district must be a string in the form "10A" or "10B" â€” a number between 1 and 67 with "A" or "B" appended at the end. Single-digit districts should be entered WITHOUT a leading zero.
# If house = F, then district must be a bare, unquoted number between 1 and 67.
# Output will be a string giving the share of the vote received in that district by Clinton and Trump in a sentence.
# Created by David H. Montgomery of the St. Paul Pioneer Press.
