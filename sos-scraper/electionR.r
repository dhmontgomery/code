# Scrapes results for the Aug. 9, 2016 Minnesota primary election from the Minnesota Secretary of State's FTP file, filters it down to just the competitive 2nd Congressional District primary, saves that data, and maps it.
# Requires the cd2.shp shapefile and countycode-fips converter.csv to be in the working directory. These should have been provided if you downloaded this entire folder.
# Also requires a username and password to access the Secretary of State's FTP server. This is not provided. It should be placed in a file called "sospw.txt" in the working directory; that file should be a single line with the format "username:password" with no quotes.
# Will output a csv, "cd2table.csv", and a map, "cd2map.png".
