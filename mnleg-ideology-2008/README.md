# 2008 Minnesota Legislature ideology graphs
By David H. Montgomery

A script in R to create graphs illustrating the estimated ideology of members of the 2008 Minnesota Legislature.

The ideology estimates and the attached data file come from: Shor, Boris; McCarty, Nolan, 2015, "Individual State Legislator Shor-McCarty Ideology Data, June 2015 update", http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/THDBRA, Harvard Dataverse, V1 [UNF:6:yYhmXwI1JvPI6PUPdwX9Wg==]. A subset of that data — limited to just the 2008 Minnesota Legislature — is republished here under the Creative Commons public domain license of the original.

The code here is ©2016 The Pioneer Press. At present all rights are reserved.

This code will function without change as long as your R working directory is set to the folder containing 08mnleg.csv.

Output of the default code will be a graph highlighting the estimated ideologies of future U.S. Reps. Erik Paulsen and Tom Emmer and Paulsen's 2016 DFL challenger, Terri Bonoff:

The code can be changed following instructions in its commenting to highlight different lawmakers, or to customize the display.
