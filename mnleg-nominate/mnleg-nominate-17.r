# Script that will download roll call data for the Minnesota House of Representatives from openstates.org and calculate W-NOMINATE roll call ideology estimates for every lawmaker in the 2017 Minnesota House of Represdentatives.
# Inputs required: none
# Outputs produced: "nomscores.csv", a spreadsheet containing each lawmaker and their ideology estimate. This can be used in the companion scripts, "nominate-elex.r" and "nominate-rank.r, to produce graphs of the results.
# Note that these are ideology estimates only, and running sequential trials will likely produce slightly different results. This is fine. (If trials produce dramatically different results, something is likely wrong.)
# This script can be customized for other years and states available on the OpenStates bulk data site (http://openstates.org/downloads/). HOWEVER, this will require care and trial & error. Different states code their data differently, and this script is designed for Minnesota's particular coding. Data may be missing from the legislator file for non-active legislators in other Minnesota years â€” this script includes manual coding to fill in information for three lawmakers who left the Minnesota House during the two-year session.
